//About

This is a game 2048 in Windows CMD interface using programming language C++

When I made my first console game "MemeTic-Tac-Toe", I thought what should I do next.  
And my friend told me that he was creating 2048 in python for his exam (he passed the exam),  
So I thought why not to create it in C++, and I did it, from scratch!  
Only 1 library was used - iostream

One interesting thing about this 2048 game, and maybe it makes it little more special than other,  
Is that there is a cool debug menu, where you can place values at specific coordinates of 2048 grid  
Or you can load some debug cases, or stop random tiles to spawn.  

//Useful info

To enable/disable debug, press % key  
To exit current game, press 0, then n  
To spawn debug case, press # (debug mode needs to be activated)  
To show debug menu, press @  

//How to launch

Double left click on file Game_2048.exe

//How to play

Use w,a,s,d keys to move all tiles in a specific directions  
w - up, a - left, s - down, d - right

//How to win

The goal of the game 2048 is to make one tile at value 2048.  
You can do this by adding tile values, when merging them.  
For example you have 2 and 2, you merge them and you get 4,  
Then you connect 4 and 4, and you get 8, and so on until 2048.  

Good luck and have fun!
