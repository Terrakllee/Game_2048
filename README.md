This is a game 2048 in Windows CMD interface using programming language C++

When I made my first console game "MemeTic-Tac-Toe", I thought what should I do next.
And my friend told me that he was creating 2048 in python for his exam (he passed the exam), 
So I thought why not to create it in C++, and I did it, from scratch!
Only 1 library was used - <iostream>

One interesting thing about this 2048 game, and maybe it makes it little more special than other,
Is that there is a cool debug menu, where you can place values at specific coordinates of 2048 grid
Or you can load some debug cases, or stop random tiles to spawn.

//Useful info

To enable/disable debug, press % key
To exit current game, press 0, then n
To spawn debug case, press # (debug mode needs to be activated)
To show debug menu, press @

//How to launch

Double left click on file Game_2048.exe
